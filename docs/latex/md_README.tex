Ases is an esoteric programming language developed by me with the objective of be the more usable as possible.

\subsection*{Characteristics}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 65536 bytes of data memory
\item 65536 bytes of maximum size of the code
\item Registers A, B, C and D with the size of 2 bytes
\item Data Pointer of 2 bytes to point the data memory location
\item Stack of 2 bytes for work with instructions and functions
\item Any characters that is not a instruction is ignored
\end{DoxyItemize}

$\ast$ If A $>$ B \+: Sets the value of the stack for 2
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If A == B \+: Sets the value of the stack for 1
\item If A $<$ B \+: Sets the value of the stack for 0
